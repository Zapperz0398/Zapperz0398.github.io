            <p>
Hi! I am Zapperz0398. I am a self-taught developer with interests in Python, shell scripting, web development, and cybersecurity. I enjoy building software, automating repetitive tasks - such as those in the terminal, and I am overall interested in all things tech.<br><br>
Beyond coding, I am a dedicated student and forever-learner. I am currently pursuing general academics through grade school, conducting research, and attempting to earn specialized skills through various other platforms and mediums. I have a deep interest in the science of learning - which is understanding how we learn - and how I can use that to my advantage. My love for productivity makes me continuously explore and implement strategies that enhance my efficiency. I am also fascinated with the the connections between AI and productivity, as well as the effects of AI-use on the brain.<br><br>
Other than my academic pursuits, I am a casual gamer, enjoying popular titles such as PUBG Mobile. Additionally, I enjoy watching those who play games such as Rust and GTA 5 RP, where immersive storylines, characters, and revenge arcs or villains are created.<br><br>
At my core, I have a highly structured and analytical way of thinking while also striving to be a high achiever in several domains - both of which serve as my greatest strength and my biggest challenge.
